# OpenWWT-Wiki
Repository of Open WorldWide Telescope Project Information.

WorldWide Telescope (WWT) enables you to explore the universe, bringing together imagery from the best ground- and space-based telescopes in the world and combining it with 3D navigation, data visualization, and more. Please see [OpenWWT.org](http://openwwt.org/) for an overview.

Please read this Repository's Wiki.

Note: This repository and its wiki are not quite ready yet, and we are not actively accepting commits yet -- there is currently no developer support available.  Please stay tuned, and in the meantime see these repositories instead:
